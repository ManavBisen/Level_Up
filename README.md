# **Level_Up** â€“ Gamify Your Life! ðŸŽ®  

Hello! Iâ€™m **Satou** (an alias).  
This README will help you understand what this repository does and how to set it up.  

## **What Does It Do?**  
**Level_Up** is a life-gamification app inspired by the anime *Solo Leveling*. Unlike the original, this system allows **multiple users** to level up together by completing tasks and earning XP (experience points).  

### **Key Features:**  
âœ… **Leveling System** â€“ Earn XP by doing "Good Work" and daily tasks.  
âœ… **Leaderboard** â€“ Compete with others and show off your progress.  
âœ… **Bank & XP Transfers** â€“ Send XP to other users.  
âœ… **Community Chat & DMs** â€“ Communicate with other players.  
âœ… **Shop** â€“ Spend XP on items (managed by superusers).  

### **Superusers vs. Normal Users**  
- **Superusers** have admin privileges:  
  - Manage usersâ€™ XP.  
  - Assign extra tasks.  
  - Set up shop items.  
  - No daily task limits.  
- **Normal users** follow standard progression rules.
